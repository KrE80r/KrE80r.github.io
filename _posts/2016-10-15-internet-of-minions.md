   ## Internet Of Minions 
![CuAcbo9WEAAt8Ly.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/CuAcbo9WEAAt8Ly.jpg)

AKA internet-of-shit, AKA internet-of-hacked-things. IoT has been in the spotlight for a while now after [two](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/) [consecutives](https://www.ovh.com/us/news/articles/a2367.the-ddos-that-didnt-break-the-camels-vac) DDoS incidents where IoT devices were the source of the attack, just to state the problem is little bit older, many experts did warn about the situation, it started with a small imapct, like a [fridge sending spam](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-25780908) but now the situation is getting out of hand.

### A little bit of history
This kind of hacks is not new , it goes back to the dawn of internet, back then devices were not "smart" yet hence the attack was mainly on PCs, trojans like [Sub7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub7) were a famous method to inefct and control PCs, people lacking technical experience were an easy target, anti-viruses were not that good also at this time, which made torjans like Sub7 gain a handfull of ground to launch DDos attacks , but what has changed making the situation now dangerous ?


### Now everything is smart!
First what is these IoT devices ? , You know this "smart" TV, Tea kettle connected to your phone, door bell that shows you a video feed when someone knocks your door when you're not @ home and smart car etc... these are IoT devices .
Gartner estimates a typical household could contain more than 500 IoT Devices by 2022 ,but do we really need all these shit !? frankly I think NO ! 

There are some factors which makes the IoT ecosystem catastrophic:

- The rapid growth of personal internet speed

- IoT vendors doesn't have proper framework to provide updates to their devices.

- IoT average consumer doesn't know/care how to update his device (When was the last time you updated your router firmware ?)

- IoT vendors uses the same default easy-to-guess password on all their devices .


These factors are the main contribuotrs making the whole situation a ticking bomb, but is it really that bad ? , what can hackers do with these IoT devices ?

Well, a lot can be done, lets begin with the soft stuff :

- DDos doh!, specially with these high speed connection we all have now, IoT minions once owned by a hacker can be used for his own or even rented, DDos-as-a-service .

- SOCKS Proxies, hackers can use owend IoT devices to hack other machines online, so the attack will appear as if its coming from your home camera , hence your IP, and police will accuse you instead ! , once more the hacker can rent your devices to gain money .
