AKA internet-of-shit, AKA internet-of-hacked-things. IoT has been in the spotlight for a while now after [two](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/) [consecutives](https://www.ovh.com/us/news/articles/a2367.the-ddos-that-didnt-break-the-camels-vac) DDoS incidents where IoT devices were the source of the attack, just to state the problem is little bit older, many experts did warn about the situation, it started with a small imapct, like a [fridge sending spam](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-25780908) but now the situation is getting out of hand.

### A little bit of history
This kind of hacks is not new , it goes back to the dawn of internet, back then devices were not "smart" yet hence the attack was mainly on PCs, trojans like [Sub7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub7) were a famous method to inefct and control PCs, people lacking technical experience were an easy target, anti-viruses were not that good also at this time, which made torjans like Sub7 gain a handfull of ground to launch DDos attacks , but what has changed making the situation now dangerous ?


### Now everything is smart!
You have a "smart" TV, Tea kettle talking to your phone, door bell that shows you a video feed when someone knocks your door when you're not @ home etc... 
Gartner estimates a typical household could contain more than 500 IoT Devices by 2022 ,Do we really need all these shit !?
There are some factors which makes the IoT ecosystem catastrophic:

- The rapid growth of personal internet speed

- IoT ecosystem has no framework for providing updates.

- IoT average consumer doesn't know/care how to update his device (When was the last time you updated your router firmware ?)

- IoT vendors use a defaut easy-to-guess passwords .
